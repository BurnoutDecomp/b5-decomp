// Canonical home for BrnProgression::ETrainingType -- the enumeration of every
// training-tip ("Easy Drive tutorial message") the game can request. DWARF home is
// SharedClasses/Progression/BrnTrainingTypes.h (BrnTrainingTypes.h:29). The enumerator
// VALUES are DWARF-attested and gated against the X360 TrainingManager bodies:
//   * RequestTraining (0x82365B20) asserts `leTrainingType >= 0 && leTrainingType <
//     E_TRAINING_TYPE_COUNT`, and the X360 compares the argument against 0x100 (256) ==
//     E_TRAINING_TYPE_COUNT -> COUNT is 256, the timed-tip ids live at 128.
//   * The DoesTrainingPauseGame / IsTipAllowedInGameMode / RequestTraining switch cases
//     index these enumerators directly (e.g. case 50 == E_TRAINING_TYPE_BOOST, the
//     "boost training" tip; cases 41/42/43 == the three INTRO_TO_ONLINE tips).
//
// NOTE on the trailing DWARF rows: the Feb-2007 DWARF lists the timed-tip span as a small
// secondary block whose names collide numerically (TIMED_TIP_1 == TIMED_TIP_END == 128,
// TIMED_TIP_COUNT == 0). C++ forbids two enumerators with the same value only when they
// would create ambiguity at use sites -- here they are distinct *names* sharing a value,
// which is legal. They are reproduced verbatim so call sites that spell the timed-tip
// names resolve, and so E_TRAINING_TYPE_COUNT keeps its attested value of 256.
