// CgsMemory::Relocator - the block-copy engine the resource pool's emergency defragmenter
// and the replay GPU disk-write stream both drive. A caller fills a RelocationParams with a
// list of (source, destination, size) ops and calls Execute; the Relocator latches that list
// into its job-data block, submits one job, and the job body performs the copies. Update
// polls (or blocks on) that job and reports whether the engine is idle again.
//

//   sizeof == 1024 on the console; RelocationParams is a separate 16-byte object the caller
//   owns (the pool module embeds one immediately after its Relocator).
