//
// BrnDirector::MomentSharedInfo -- the per-frame context the director hands to every moment's
// Update. It is one copy of the player's vehicle snapshot followed by the pointers and gates a
// moment needs to decide whether its shot is on: which cars are live, what the game state is
// doing, the camera parameter banks, and the crash/takedown analysis.
//
// The whole moment family reaches this record through free-function shims declared at the head
// of each Moments/*.cpp (`detail::MomentSharedInfo_*`), because Moment::Update's third argument
// is type-erased to `const void*` in this tree. That erasure is the reason the record had no
// home for so long -- nothing forced it to exist. The shims are bodied against THIS definition
// in BrnMomentSharedInfo.cpp; when the family's Update signature is un-erased they collapse
// into ordinary member reads and this header is what they read.
//
// Member names, types and ORDER are the record's own. Offsets are NOT reproduced and must not
// be: the console build has 4-byte pointers and this host has 8, so every member past the
// leading vehicle snapshot diverges by construction. Parity is BY NAMED MEMBER -- the same rule
// the arbitrator state container and the camera parameter bank state for their sub-objects.
//
// ⭐ THE PRODUCER IS BODIED (2026-09-24, FX-DIRECTOR): MainDirector::UpdateMoments @0x82250268 builds
// one on its stack every frame and hands it to MomentController::UpdateAllMoments @0x82239DE8.
// ⚠ Its CALL in MainDirector::Update (0x82274348) is still gated -- two behaviours the moments pool
// are hollow shells (see the GATE there) -- so no shim below is reachable at runtime yet.
//
// ⓘ TWELVE SHIM NAMES DO NOT MATCH THE MEMBER THEY LAND ON, and the shim names are the ones
// that are wrong -- they were coined from each call site's role before the record existed.
// Every displacement below is the call site's own; what changed is that the member it lands on
// is now known. The ten short entries each read as "shim name -> member":
//   HasTakedownVictim     -> GameState::mbTakedownActive (the SAME flag WasTakedown reads; it
//                            says a takedown happened, not that a victim slot is filled)
//   GetStuntFlags         -> GameState::miThisFramesActionFlags
//   GetTimeCrashing       -> GameState::mfCrashTimeRemaining (remaining, NOT elapsed -- the
//                            stationary-crash moment's ICE-take-fits test reads the opposite
//                            sense from what its name suggests)
//   IsCrashCameraActive   -> GameState::mbCanUseSlomo
//   GetCrashModeWord      -> GameState::meEventType (crash mode is one of its enumerators)
//   GetAirborneHeight     -> RaceCarState::mfTimeInAir (seconds, not a height; "0 == grounded"
//                            is still right)
//   GetCrashElapsed       -> RaceCarState::mAboveGroundTestResult.mfVerticalDistance
//   HasCrashDynamics      -> RaceCarState::mAboveGroundTestResult.mbValid
//   GetCrashSpeedDiff     -> RaceCarState::mTransform.yAxis lane 1, i.e. how upright the car
//                            still is -- nothing to do with speed
//   GetSegmentReference   -> RaceCarState::mLinearVelocity (so the look-back's "projection"
//                            is a time to alignment in seconds, not a position parameter)
// and the two that were already recorded:
//   MomentSharedInfo_GetCrashVehicleIndex  reads mePlayerActiveRaceCarIndex, which is the
//       PLAYER's active race-car index, not the crashing car's. Three moment TUs read it under
//       the crash name; on the paths that reach it the player IS the crashing car, so the uses
//       are right even though the name is not.
//   MomentSharedInfo_IsCrashCameraBlocked  reads GameState::mbRoadRageTotalled. That flag does
//       block the bystander/tumbling crash shot, but for one specific reason: a totalled
//       road-rage car is the spiralling deathcam's, which ArbStateCrashing::Prepare selects off
//       the same flag.
// Renaming them is a separate pass across nine TUs and is deliberately not done here.
//
// ⓘ The record's layout was re-derived independently of the member order below: every shim's
// displacement, mapped through an offsetof probe of GameState / RaceCarState / PlayerCrashInfo,
// lands on exactly one member and leaves no gaps -- and those three sub-structs carry no
// pointer past their head, so their host layout IS the record's.
