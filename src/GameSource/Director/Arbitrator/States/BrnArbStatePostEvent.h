//
// BrnDirector::ArbStatePostEvent -- the director arbitrator state that runs the camera
// "post-event" sequence once an event has finished (the results / winner reveal): it asks
// the resource manager for the event-completion shot-group, picks the appropriate
// completion shot for the live finish-line geometry, allocates an ICE-anim camera
// behaviour to play it, and walks the post-event state machine INACTIVE -> PREPARING ->
// ACTIVE -> CHANGING_TO_ROAMING, handing control back to the roaming state once the take
// has finished. Derives from ArbitratorState (vtable order pinned by the base).
//
// LAYOUT: the member names and declaration order are attested for this build; the
// per-member offsets quoted below are pinned from Construct / Prepare / Update / Release:
//   * mCamera is the base ArbitratorState's by-value Camera at +0x10 (this state reaches it
//     by name through the base GetNonConstCamera(); Construct constructs it in place, Update
//     copies the behaviour's produced camera into it).
//   * mfTimeActive  @+0x180 (f32) -- declared member 0; NOT touched by this TU's recovered
//                    function set (Construct does not zero it, nothing reads it). Modelled
//                    at the slot preceding mbPlayedFlash; FLAG: its role is declared but
//                    unexercised here.
//   * mbPlayedFlash @+0x184 (bool) -- Construct zeroes it; Update's ACTIVE case reads/sets
//                    it to gate the one-shot "Car_Reset" flash effect.
//   * meState       @+0x188 (EState, the post-event state machine value)
//   * mPostEventCam @+0x18C (BehaviourHandle, 0x14) -- the ICE-anim cam handle
// Parity is BY NAMED MEMBER (the project's x64-gate rule): the 4-byte-pointer offsets
// quoted above are provenance; on the x64 host the embedded Camera widens, so absolute
// offsets shift -- the member ROLES are what is reproduced.
