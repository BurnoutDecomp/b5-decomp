//
// BrnDirector::ArbStateRankUp -- the director arbitrator state that runs the "rank up"
// camera sequence (the post-event ICE-anim flourish that cycles a camera "take" per rival
// as the player climbs the rankings). It allocates an ICE-anim camera behaviour, plays the
// rank-up shot-group's shots one rival at a time, and walks the state machine
// INACTIVE -> PREPARING -> ACTIVE -> CHANGING_TO_ROAMING, handing control back to the
// roaming state once the take has finished (or once the player's rank-up is no longer
// active). Derives from ArbitratorState (vtable order pinned by the base).
//
// LAYOUT: member names and declaration order are reproduced from the shipped build; the
// per-member console offsets are recorded as +0xNN:
//   * mCamera is the base ArbitratorState's by-value Camera @+0x10 (this state reaches it by
//     name through the base GetNonConstCamera() / the effect-trigger free functions;
//     Construct calls Camera::Construct on it).
//   * mIceCam   +0x180 (BehaviourHandle, 0x14) -- the ICE-anim cam handle (Construct zeroes
//                its five words: mbAllocated +0x180, muAllocationKey +0x184,
//                the owning helper-pool pointer +0x188, mpManager +0x18C, mpBehaviour +0x190)
//   * miRival   +0x194 (the rival index walked through the shot list; Update increments it
//                each frame the game moves to the next rival and indexes the shot list by it
//                modulo the shot count)
//   * meState   +0x198 (EState, the rank-up state machine value; the dispatch is indexed by
//                this value 0..3, default -> assert)
// Parity is BY NAMED MEMBER (the project's x64-gate rule): the 4-byte-pointer offsets quoted
// above are provenance; on the x64 host the embedded Camera widens, so absolute offsets
// shift -- the member ROLES are what is reproduced.
