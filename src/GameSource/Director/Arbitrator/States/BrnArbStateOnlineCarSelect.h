//
// BrnDirector::ArbStateOnlineCarSelect -- the director arbitrator state that runs the camera
// for the ONLINE car-select / livery screen (the pre-race lobby where each player picks their
// car/livery before an online race intro). It owns two camera behaviours -- an ICE-anim
// "reveal" cam (the black-and-white car reveal) and a "rotate about vehicle" cam (the look-
// around-car / car-mod screen orbit) -- and walks a state machine
// INACTIVE -> PREPARING -> SELECTING_CAR -> SELECTING_LIVERY -> WAIT_TO_CHANGE_TO_INTRO ->
// CHANGING_TO_INTRO / CHANGING_TO_ROAMING, fading the screen in/out (the "Black_Out_BW" /
// "Black_In_BW" / "Black_*(No_B_W)" / "BlackFadeIn_Quick" camera-PFX hooks) and handing
// control to the online race-intro state once the player is ready (or back to roaming if the
// car-select is aborted). Derives from ArbitratorState (vtable order pinned by the base).
//
// LAYOUT: the member names and declaration order are the shipped build's; the per-member
// console offsets quoted below are pinned from Construct / Prepare / Update / Release:
//   * mCamera is the base ArbitratorState's by-value Camera @+0x10 (this state reaches it by
//     name through the base GetNonConstCamera() / the effect-trigger free functions;
//     Construct calls Camera::Construct(this+0x10)).
//   * mIceCam          @+0x180 (BehaviourHandle, 0x14) -- the ICE-anim reveal cam handle
//                       (Construct zeroes its five words: mbAllocated@+0x180,
//                       muAllocationKey@+0x184, muHelperIndex@+0x188, mpManager@+0x18C,
//                       mpBehaviour@+0x190).
//   * mLookAroundCarCam @+0x194 (BehaviourHandle, 0x14) -- the rotate-about-vehicle (look-
//                       around-car) cam handle (zeroed +0x194..+0x1A4 like mIceCam).
//   * mbWasCarModScreen @+0x1A8 (bool) -- whether the SELECTING_LIVERY (car-mod) screen has
//                       been entered; selects which produced camera the later states copy
//                       (the look-around cam vs the ICE reveal cam) and which "No_B_W" vs
//                       "_BW" fade hook plays. NOT seeded by Construct (the console's
//                       Construct does not write +0x1A8).
//   * meState          @+0x1AC (EState, the car-select state machine value; the dispatch
//                       table is indexed by this value 0..6, default -> assert).
// Parity is BY NAMED MEMBER (the project's x64-gate rule): the console's 4-byte-pointer offsets
// quoted above are provenance; on the x64 host the embedded Camera widens, so absolute
// offsets shift -- the member ROLES are what is reproduced.
