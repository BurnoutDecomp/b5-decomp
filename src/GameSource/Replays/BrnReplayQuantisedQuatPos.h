// BrnReplays::QuantisedQuatPos -- packs/unpacks a quaternion-orientation + position
// pair into a compact 12-byte replay record. No type information recovered;
// the surface below is taken from the call sites in TrafficEntitySerialiser:
//
//   WriteAsQuatPos : builds an 8-float scratch (quat lanes + position +
//       a derived term) then `QuantisedQuatPos::Pack(out12, scratchFloats)` and writes
//       the 12-byte result with BaseSerialiser::Write(this, out12, 12).
//   ReadAsQuatPos : reads 12 bytes with BaseSerialiser::Read(this, in12, 12),
//       then `QuantisedQuatPos::UnPack(out32, in12)` reconstructs the quat+pos and the
//       caller VMX-expands it into the destination transform. UnPack returns its out ptr.
//
// The exact float layout of the scratch / unpacked buffers is produced by VMX code in
// the caller and is not separately attested as named fields; Pack/UnPack are therefore
// declared with byte/float buffer parameters and their bodies live in the QuantisedQuatPos TU
// (BrnReplayQuantisedQuatPos.cpp).
