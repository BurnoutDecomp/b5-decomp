        // ⚠️ WHAT THAT DIVERGENCE IS *NOT* -- MEASURED 2026-09-07, correcting this file's own first
        // banner. That banner said "seeded 0, slot 0's bounding box is skipped for the whole of the
        // first sweep". It is not, and the reason is one line of the callee: on an EMPTY pool BOTH
        // arms return KI_INVALID_BITINDEX and `stw r11, 0x60E8` stores -1 anyway, so a 0 seed is
        // overwritten on the very first frame and can only matter if the first UpdateABoundingBox
        // after Construct sees a pool that is already live. It never does here: over 8 boots the
        // [ubb-seed] probe below recorded exactly ONE Construct per boot, each with an empty pool
        // (`liveCountOnEntry 0`), and [ubb] recorded `firstCall cursor -1 live 0` in all eight --
        // and every boot's first sweep began at slot 0 ([ubb-sweep1] `slots 0`, `0 1`, `0 1 2`).
        // ⇒ THE SEED IS CORRECT AS SOURCE AND LATENT AT RUNTIME. Keep it -1 because that is the
        // console's store; do not claim a witnessed consequence for it. [[diagnostics-that-lie]]
